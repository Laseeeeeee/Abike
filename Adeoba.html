            <p>
                It's crazy how even after everything, you still give me butterflies.
                Three years later and you still have that effect on me.
                <br><br>
                I know things haven't always been perfect between us, but one thing
                that has never changed is how special you are to me.
                Distance, misunderstandings, time… none of it has ever erased what
                I feel when I think about you.
                <br><br>
                Valentine's is tomorrow, and I don't want to act like it's just another day.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Will you be my Valentine tomorrow? ❤️</strong>
            </p>
